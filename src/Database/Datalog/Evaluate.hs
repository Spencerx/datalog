-- | Bindings are vectors of values.  Each variable in a rule is
-- assigned an index in the Bindings during the adornment process.
-- When evaluating a rule, if a free variable is encountered, all of
-- its possible values are entered at the index for that variable in a
-- Bindings vector.  When a bound variable is encountered, its current
-- value is looked up from the Bindings.  If that value does not match
-- the concrete tuple being examined, that tuple is rejected.
--
-- The mapping of variable to index into the bindings vector is stored
-- in the Rule data structure.

-- | Apply a set of rules.  All of the rules must have the same head
-- relation.  This is what implements the semi-naive evaluation
-- strategy.  For each rule of the form
--
-- > T(x,y) |- G(x,z), T(z,y).
--
-- simulate the rule
--
-- > ΔT(x,y) |- G(x,z), ΔT(z,y).
--
-- That is, at each step only look at the *new* tuples for each
-- recursive relation.  The intuition is that, if a new tuple is to be
-- generated on the next step, it must reference a new tuple from this
-- step (otherwise it would have already been generated) If a relation
-- appears twice in a body:
--
-- > T(x,y) |- T(x,z), T(z,y).
--
-- we have to substitute ΔT once for *each* occurrence of T in the
-- body, with the other occurrences referencing the non-Δ table:
--
-- > ΔT(x,y) |- ΔT(x,z), T(z,y).
-- > ΔT(x,y) |- T(x,z), ΔT(z,y).
--
-- While collecting all of the new tuples (see projectLiteral), a new
-- Δ table is generated.
